Global Terrorism data analysist with jupyter notebook and google data studio
Github restrict file size maximum 25mb so i will share link to data:
+ Original data csv link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/19EtZ5Rt4kMF-IVJf8l0ReZJ6yat5CSjb/view?usp=sharing
+ HDF file converted link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1imK-XiazBf_Wb3SVcL6ITWoIFEfNNP5t/view?usp=sharing
For the google data studio to make report. Maxium file size csv is 100mb for free while data size is 155mb
So i cannot make a report using google data studio
Since the file ipnb is quite large, loading in github view may prove fruitless. So either download and reupload to jupyernotbook or google colabs or using nbviewer: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/, pass the url to render the view
Github and nbviewer can only render static web, plotly using js to display images, so i download the png and show it again, so there are some inconviniences.
